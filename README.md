# Shadowrun 5 system for Foundry VTT
This is an unoffical implementation of the [Catalyst Game Labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/shadowrun/) fifth edition of Shadowrun RPG for Foundry VTT. (And translated in French by our friends of [Black Book Editions](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/), "cocorico!") 

This system is made by fans, for fans, and is not associated with Catalyst Game Labs or their partners in any way.

The system for Foundry VTT contains no proprietary content from the official RPG sourcebooks. It is intended to make the process of enjoying Shadowrun 5 via an online tabletop experience as easy as possible but you will still need to purchase official sourcebooks and enter data yourself in order to enjoy this system as intended.

## Languages
This system is fully translated in English and French

## Main features
The system is heavily automatised, main features are:
- auto calculation of all derived data on character sheets
- support for character modifications thanks to a robust item effect system
- combat sequence fully automatised with: 
    - combat tracker keeping track of initiative changes, pass and round
    - range, fire mode, scatter, cumulative recoil, cumulative defense, active defenses, calleds shots...
- magic support: cast spell, summon spirit, create preparation, use Reagents and handle Drain and effects automatically...
- matrix support: handle marks, matrix damage, biofeedback damage, dumpshock, compile sprite, use complex form, keep track of Overwatch score and more...
- rigging support: manage your drones and vehicles, handle modifications, load autosofts...
- full "sidekick" support. You can summon a spirit, compile a sprite, launch a drone... use it as an actor and bring it back in your "inventory".
- contextual help with details for all calculations.

...and more...

...and: it's fully skinned :)

...but, there's still a lot to do :/
